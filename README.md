## Prompt: Write a story about a boy who finds his love for music while learning to play the guitar.

### Completion: 

Most things he noticed were uninteresting. The boy didn’t know it yet, but music would help change that forever. Rapid-fire melodies and rhythms caught his attention, and the people playing guitar on TV looked the coolest. He had received a guitar for Christmas one year. It was fun to play, but it didn’t sound that great to him. He didn’t know about the technicalities of different music genres, but he could hear them. 

After arriving at his friend’s house to watch a game, he noticed a plain, silver guitar leaning against the wall. He asked about it and learned that his friend had won it at an event in a raffle-style giveaway. Not wanting to give away his interest, he didn’t mention it again for a few hours. Someone else brought it up again. His friend said, “I don’t really want it. It was just cool to win it.” He commented on the condition of the strings, curious if his friend would appreciate him changing them. “Oh, sure, man. Go for it. You can keep it, honestly.” Feelings of excitement filled him to the brim. It was the kind of guitar that he saw his favorite bands playing. He couldn’t wait to get his hands on it.

Upon arrival at home, the boy took the guitar from his back seat and into his bedroom. After replacing the strings and adding a strap, he began playing whatever came to mind. It sounded just right. His unconditioned ears couldn’t hear the nuances in how muddy the tone was. He only noticed that each strum and palm-muted note he played had the most amazing tone and texture he could imagine. It even sounded good with low volume; He had to keep it down since the rest of his family were sleeping.

It didn’t matter. The boy had played every song he had learned through tablature, over and over again. His hands were warm. The strings under his fingers felt wonderful. The tips of his fingers had become very sensitive. His body coursed with excitement and elation. The new strings sounded and felt great. The rich tone and resonance offered by the new steel sounded perfect. He kept detuning and retuning each string, longing to hear a perfect harmony between them when they were in tune.

He began listening more intently to his music. He listened for the timing that made the song sound just so. He started counting in his head, tapping and nodding to the beat. It quickly became obvious that playing two notes quickly together, versus spread apart, completely changed the melody. He longed to be able to write his own music but was resigned to playing what his idols played. It brought him relief and relaxation. It felt like the only time that nothing else really mattered. He knew that he had just entered a new stage of life and was glad to be there.





Every day required some playing time. He had a stack of new strings sitting on the desk after deciding to always have fresh ones available. Frustration began to end his jam sessions. Only the most melodically complex and quick songs kept his interest. However, they took more time to learn, which posed a challenge. Was it really better to slowly learn numerous, small riffs that eventually fit together rather than simple ones that took only a few minutes to pick up? He wasn’t convinced and played only short parts from popular songs.

Repeating short riffs over and over was all he needed to feel the flow and escape from reality. He acquired muscle memory from certain riffs very quickly and would run through a handful of them when he got home. It was slightly distressing that he couldn’t play every song that he liked. With great expectations, he tried and failed to play some sophisticated melodies and scales. It didn’t make sense and his hands weren’t working. Some friends suggested that he study music theory or learn staff music. It just wasn’t an interesting topic to him at the time. He was limited but it didn’t bother him too much. The solution was simple, listen to other bands that were similar, but not as cool as what he liked. There was so much variety, it seemed endless. Endless was also the feeling that consumed him when he played. It was pure magic. 

The boy didn’t get to talk much about music. None of his friends played an instrument, nor did they seem interested in the least. This confused him. It was ok, he thought. He was certain he’d find fellow musicians in the future and could only imagine how fun that would be. 

He began noticing more aspects of music and the music theory his friend suggested. Small aspects of instructional music videos began to make more sense. This was very fun for him, but also startling. There seemed to be a massive part of music that he didn’t recognize, let alone understand. The horizons of his taste in music began to broaden, namely different styles of timing. It blew his mind that the time between notes changed the character of a melody so drastically. Some musicians posted playthrough videos of their songs, offering gems of wisdom concerning the tricks of their trade. These provided an expert lesson on melodies that swept him away from reality. Music was therapy. The challenge to coordinate his hands perfectly to produce some monumental sounds left him bristling.

He felt the power of the sound and the resonance. Although the amplifier was making the actual sound, he could see how the strings vibrated and became slightly transparent when they were strummed. There was almost no aspect of music that he didn’t like, except for sheet music. He was slightly embarrassed that he had learned to play through tablature. It got him this far and nothing about sheet music made sense to him. All he needed was to hear the music and see the notes that were played. From there, he’d play the notes and change whatever he needed until he recognized the melody. Once the riff he played was easy to recognize, he practiced at different speeds to better understand its parts. 

Music opened the door to the science of art. This would eventually open the door to sciences alone, which also took him some time to grasp. He felt better about his place in the world, with music and science to pore over.
